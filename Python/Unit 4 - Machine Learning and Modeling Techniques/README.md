## Outcomes:
+ A solid foundation of machine learning techniques, and how to use them in Python.
+ Understand and use the modeling process and why it's important for all machine learning. 
+ How to leverage Python's advanced libraries to perform Machine Learning.

## Projects:
+ Used Machine Learning technique, linear regression to predict Boston housing market prices.
+ Used Machine Learning technique, logistic regression to predict if a passenger was more likely to survive the Titanic and to predict whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.
+ Used Machine Learning technique, KNN on a Classified dataset.
  + Learned how to standardize data, the impact different K-values have on a model and how to choose the right K-value with high accuracy and less error.
+ Used Machine Learning technique, random forest to explore Amazon Alexa Review data and perform sentiment analysis.
  + Learned how to efficiently convert categorical values to numerical values and the importance of including less features in the model.
