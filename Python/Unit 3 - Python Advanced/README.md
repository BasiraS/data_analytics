# Data Analytics & Descriptive Statistics in Python

Built on the topics learned in the previous units, dived deeper into data analysis and statistics using Python. 
Imported data from multiples sources, including excel and csv files.  
Explored real-world business cases using popular and relevant scientific data analysis libraries.

## Topics covered: 
+ NumPy
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib, Seaborn
+ Data wrangling 
+ Data visualization 
+ Regression

## Outcomes:
+ Use NumPy and Pandas to gather data from various sources (excel, csv, etc.), and clean and transform that data.
+ Create visualizations to communicate findings in Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other visualization tools.
+ Understand hypothesis testing and how it's used in solving business use cases.

## Projects: 
+ Performed analysis on various tasks and activities performed by a data analyst professional and summarized the analysis.
+ [Assignment](https://github.com/BasiraS/data_analytics_2/tree/main/Python/Unit%203%20-%20Python%20Advanced/Assignments):
  + Used *numpy* package to answer questions dealing with top olympic countries. Created subset arrays to match criteria to answer the questions.  
  + Performed data analysis on salaries dataset. Calculated mean, median, and performed basic data transformations on the dataset and visualized the dataset by making scatter plots and histograms. Lastly, I drew conclusions based on my findings. 
+ [Mini Projects](https://github.com/BasiraS/data_analytics_2/tree/main/Python/Unit%203%20-%20Python%20Advanced/Mini%20Project):
  + Analyzed Covid-19 dataset and gain insights from underlying data. Created a PowerPoint on my data analysis on the dataset.
