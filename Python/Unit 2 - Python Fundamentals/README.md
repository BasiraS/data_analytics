# Python Programming Fundamentals

Explored Python 3.  
Learned the fundamentals of Python, such as list, dictionary, loops, if-else statements, and build-in functions, etc., which set the stage for more advanced data analytics topics.

## Topics covered: 
+ Variable assignments and data types
+ Data Structure: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuple
+ Conditional Operations: If Statements, else, elif
+ Logical Operations: AND, OR, NOT Functions
+ Built-in Functions and Custom Functions

## Outcomes of this unit:
+ A solid foundation of Python Programming fundamentals
+ Start using Python as a primary data analysis programming language
+ How to loop through a dataset and perform different tasks
+ Create, use, and understand why functions are useful and necessary for programming.

## Projects:
In addition to multiple assignments that provide practice on core concepts, I engaged in projects that helped develop skills in crearting functions and looping through datasets.

      + Check if the input is odd or even, if it is multiple of 4. More generally, define a function that takes in two numbers and check whether the first number is divisible by the second. 
      + Rock, paper, scissor game: define a function that takes two inputs and determine who wins.
