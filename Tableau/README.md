Organizations use dashboards to keep track of their day-to-day, and long-term business objectives - from keeping track of patient admissions 
in an emergency department, to tracking spend vs. budgets.  

In this lesson, I learned how to create visualizations that tell meaningful stories that viewers and users can clearly identify and understand to help keep track of business objectives.
