# Data, Databases, and SQL

Gained an overview of data, databases and SQL using PostgreSQL. The skills I learned are applicable to any other major SQL databases, such as Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and others.

Explored what exactly data is, why it's useful, and what types of hidden questions data can help bring to light. 

Using SQL, allowed me to extract, manipulate, transform, and visualize data to answer important business related questions.

## Topics covered:
+ What is data? How does it relate to business? 
+ SQL Statement fundamentals
+ GROUP BY Statements
+ JOINS
+ Creating Databases and Tables

## Outcomes:
+ A solid foundation of gathering data with SQL - from simple to complex queries.
+ How to create databases, tables, and import data into that database and perform queries on it. 

## Projects
In addition to multiple assignments that provide practice on core concepts, I engaged in projects that helped me develop skills in joining tables, updating tables, and querying data, as well as, building a database and an ER Diagram from scratch.
